            In attacking festival ads, the<br>

             needs a talisman, it is the first<br> 
             Diwali of independent India.<br>
             On October 18, when I looked at<br>
            FabIndia’s “Jashn-e-Riwaz” <br>
            advertisement – which Surya,<br>
             the BJP MP from Bengaluru <br>

            was celebration of Nabi Dinam,<br> birthday
             of Prophet Mohammed,<br> which fell on the<br>
              following day, October 19<br>

             focus on the Hindu festival<br>
              of Diwali by both the pro-<br>
               and anti-ad groups, there<br> 
               was hardly any cognizance<br>
                of a Muslim festival around <br>
                the corner. Between me, who<br>
                 would immediately and wrongly<br>
                  associate even fake-sounding<br>
                   Urdu with Muslim identity in<br> 
                   India, and Surya, who would<br>
